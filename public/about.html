<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Hetanshi Vora, an undergraduate student studying computer science. I love to code, although I only started recently.
  Some of my hobbies are reading, listening to music, arts and crafts and making beaded jewellery.
</p>

<p>I'm very new to coding so I don't have much experience but I'm eager to learn and as you read this, I'm designing my own project portfolio to showcase to the world.
  People around me would say I'm a kind-hearted person with an ambiverted personality but those who know me well know I can go crazy with my group of people. 
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I'm excited to embark on this journey to code, analyse and sail my way through web development, for starters. 
  That's all and more for later!
</p>
